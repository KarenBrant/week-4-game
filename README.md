The game "Crystal Collectors" allows a user to click on 4 different crystals with random numbers associated (between 1 and 12) 
with them in order to match the random number between 19 and 120 generated by the computer.  It is just for fun, although it 
can aid in addition skills. 
Start the game by simply clicking on a crystal.  The game will then prompt the user to type a y to continue playing or a n to
stop playing.  The game will also tell the user whether each round was a win or a loss.
Detailed instructions are given with the game.
